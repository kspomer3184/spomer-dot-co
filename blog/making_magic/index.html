	I started working for The Walt Disney Company in February of 2017 after the research project that I was on exhausted its funding. 
        Being a little tight on money, I accepted a role in Quick Service Food & Beverage, that being in the highest demand at the time.
        Disney likes to leave an air of mystery around where you are going to be working. All I knew when I accepted the offer was that
        I was to be working somewhere in the Magic Kingdom. I had no idea that I would end up working in the kitchen of the highest volume 
        (and therefore highest stress) restaurant in the western hemisphere.

        The first day of work for all Cast Members working for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts is an all day training called "Disney Traditions".
        Traditions teaches you about the vision Walt had for the company and how that has been followed through with today. You learn all about
        the company culture and the subtle things that sets Disney apart from the competition. Following my Traditions day, I went through 5 more
        days of training about park operations, food and beverage operations and finally my on-the-job training.
        <br><br>
        After a whirlwind 3 days of location training, I was thrown into work at Cosmic Ray's Starlight Caf√©, one of the busiest kitchens in the 
	world. It took a couple of weeks to get the hang of things, and I was finally able to perform really well. The kitchen at Cosmic Ray's is
	a very high pressure place. A simple mistake or lapse in judgement can result in thousands of upset guests. There's many positions where 
	you are the only thing preventing a complete standstill in the whole restaurant. It was hard work, but I would much prefer that to idly 
	standing around in a less busy location.
	<br><br> 
	After a month or two I was scheduled my first Greeter shift. The greeter position is untrained, and basically everyone at the restaurant 
	has to do it occasionally. This was my first taste of guest interaction and Making Magic. I got to give stickers to kids, sing birthday 
	songs and give out free food to people who looked like they might have been having a bad day. It was while greeting that I realized just
	how much I loved working for this company. It helped to give me a direction with what I wanted to do with my career. 
	<br></p>
        <div class="col-sm-5"><img class="img-responsive" src="space.jpg"></div>
  <p style = "font-size:18px"><br> 
	In an effort to get more guest interaction than the occasional greeter shift, I signed up for cashier training. The cashier position 
	combined the fast paced work environment of the kitchen with the heavy guest interaction of greeting, and was by far my favorite.
	<br><br>
	As I got about halfway through the Fall semester of my senior year, I realized that I needed to make a big choice. The amount of time
	that I was spending at work was starting to impact my performance in classes. Cashiers at Cosmic Ray's were spread thin, getting more 
	frequent and longer shifts than anyone else. I decided that I needed to step away from Disney for a time, so that I could finish off the
	semester strong. I left the comapany in mid-October. 
	<br><br>
	I interviewed for an Attractions role on the last day of that semester. As I sit writing this, I am five days away from my second (and 
	if all goes well, final) "Disney Traditions" class. I'll be going back to the world's busiest theme park, starting with Frontierland 
	attractions in the coming weeks.
