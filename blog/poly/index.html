  I've always been proud of my school, and have never had a hard time talking about it. I started as a tour guide in the
  admissions department even before I started classes. Over the following year or so I gave tours to thousands of prosepctive
  students, hopefully doing my part to show off the awesome things about the place I call home.
  <br><br>
  Usually when you're talking about something you love, you don't mention that it was all about the money, but that's how this
  story gets it's start. After being pretty set on going to the University of South Florida, I recieved some interesting mail.
  I got a scholarship award letter from the back-up school right by my parents' house that I really didn't know much about. They
  offered me enough money to pay tuition, books, and housing. If I were to go here, I would basically just have to pay to feed
  myself; a pretty tempting step-up from the debt I planned on going into at USF. It definitely now seemed worth it to go on a
  tour and find out what the place was like.
  <br><br>
  When I showed up for my tour, I wasn't suprised by the normal eye-catcher, the IST building, which looks like something between
  architectural icon and space reptile. I had seen that countless times, having lived in the area. What did surprise me was the lack
  of anything else. The campus at that point was essentially 3 buildings. The IST, a residence hall and the Wellness Center or dining
  hall. It was certainly nothing like the small city that was the USF campus I had toured a couple weeks prior. While some may have seen this
  desolence as offputting, but I saw it as intruiging.
  <br><br>
  To this day, I have never been in a building more impressive than the Innovation Science & Technolgy building. It was built with the
  same kind of innovative spirit that it fosters. Having literally everything you need academically in one place is an awesome perk.
  Every professor's office is just feet from the student commons, and every classroom and lab are just beneath it. I've learned so much
  in this place, and it scares me to think that I will be leaving it someday soon.
