          My name is Kyle Spomer, and I'm a student at Florida Polytechnic
          University, as well as a Cast Member at Walt Disney World. I've made this
          website is to give updates about what's going on in my life,
          as well as to show off some of the projects I've worked on.
          <br><br>
          I have considered myself a maker for as long as I can remember; whether it
          was the DIY circuits kit that my grandmother gave me when I was six years old,
          the love for cooking that I've had since I was 10, the windmill design competition
          that I won in 8th grade, or the passion for woodworking that I've had for the last
          3 years. I live for the design and construction process. It's such a rewarding
          experience to follow something from just a kernel of an idea, to multiple iterations
          of building, and in the end being able to have a final product that does something
          worth doing.
          <br><br>
          My love for making brought me to that path that I am on today. I am currently a senior
          in Computer Engineering at Florida Polytechnic University, a brand new state university
          solely focuses on science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Florida Poly takes
          a very innovative approach to a STEM education through small class sizes and project
          based curriculum. My choice to attend Poly has brought about so many opportunities for
          which I am endlessly grateful. You can read more about my decision and journey
          <a href="/blog/poly">here.</a>
          <br><br>
          Most recently, I've come to work part time as a Cast Member at Walt Disney World. Working
          at Cosmic Ray's Starlight Caf√© in the Magic Kingdom, I have learned so much about a new kind of
          making, what I want to do with my career and how I want to impact the world. "Making Magic" as
          we call it has such profound impact on our guests and the cast members who get to do it. Being
          able to make magic has made me realize that anything you can do to bring others joy is worth doing.
          Read more about my experience as a cast member <a href="/blog/making_magic">here.</a>
          <br><br>
          To the left are links to some of my most recent projects. All projects that I have written
          articles for can be found in the <a href="/projects">projects section.</a>

          The <a href="//blog">blog section</a> gives updates about what's going on in my
          life, as well as some other stuff that I want to talk about, but that aren't necessarily
          projects.

          The <a href="/sandbox">sandbox section</a> of the site is to give me a place to test out any
          web based applications that I'm currently working on. No guarantees on what
          will be there, or if it will be working at any given time, but check it out
          and see what I'm working on!
