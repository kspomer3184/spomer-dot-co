	Every student at Florida Poly is required to take a set of sequential courses, Design 1 & Design 2, wherein groups of
	build a solution to an industry supplied problem. Taking Design in the first year that it was offered on a large scale
	presented a lot of challenges, but even more opportunities.
    <br><br>
	We were randomly assigned groups and projects, and in the beginning (and for the next 7 months), it seemed like someone
	somewhere was out to get us. We were a group of complete strangers and were given a project that no one understood. I
	vividly remember sitting in class with our faculty advisor, staring at the problem statement and trying to figure out
	what it was that they wanted from us.
    <br><br></p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">The Problem:</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; padding: 30px">
      "We are building rectifying antennas and selective emitters for energy harvesting of thermal radiation. Ideal thermal
      radiation is described by Plank's Law and is broadband. The purpose of this project is to design a mechanism for measuring
      thermal radiation and reporting power density across the band of frequencies expected to be present according to Plank's
      Law at varying distances from the source. Students choose the thermal source, the method for measuring or calculating power
      density, the appropriate sensor, and the platform for measuring at different distances. We are building a similar device
      to measure the output of or selective emitter as well as the performance of the rectenna in response to the known performance
      of a real thermal source at 28.3THz/10.6µm."

        After what seemed like weeks of staring at that paragraph and several phone calls with our industry sponsor, we seemed to finally
	have an idea about what was going on. The problem was that we had absolutely no idea how to solve the given problem. In essence, we
	needed to build a robotic platform that needed to rotate a sensor around a source, as well as be able to automatically adjust the 
	distance between the two components. This was not necessarily the difficult part. We needed to be able to adjust the distance 
	in increments of 1/4 of the wavelength emitted by the device; 2.65 µm.
    <br></p>

	After long days of looking at parts that were either way too expensive or not nearly accurate enough, I finally had a breakthrough.
	A combination of a simple off the shelf stepper motor and a gear set with about an 8:1 reduction could provide linear motion in 2.65µm
	increments. The hardest part about constructing this proposed design would be making a custom set of gears.
    <br><br>
	After a couple more weeks of design, it became apparent that we were not going to be able to build the system that was originally 
	called for. The antennas had not been fabricated, so we would be using a simple IR led and a cheap lux sensor. This meant that the 
	linear accuracy was much less critical, and we would only have to build a proof of concept.    
    <br><br>
	Once all of our parts came in, we frantically began construction. We used the school's laser cutter to fabricate the structure with
	acrylic. We then secured the stepper motors, belts, rails, sensors and their platforms to the structure. After that, I hooked up all
	the electronics and began programming. Because the sensor we used only had a library made for Arduino, we used an Arduino Uno to
	gather sensor data, and transmit it through a serial connection to our Raspberry Pi. The Pi handled the motors and data collection. 
	The collected data would then be stored in a csv file, where we could manipulate and graph it.

	While we were never able to achieve the results we originally pictured, this project turned out pretty awesome for the things that 
	it taught us. I learned about laser cutting, stepper motors, gear ratios, and formally documenting a project. But the most important 
	thing that I learned was how to work with a team with a very diverse background and skill set. It taught me how to explain technical things
	to people who may not have the same knowledge as me. In the end I am very thankful for the seemingly impossible project that scared us
	so much in the beginning.
