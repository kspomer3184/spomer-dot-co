    Every student at Florida Poly is required to take a set of sequential courses, Design 1 & Design 2, wherein groups of
    build a solution to an industry supplied problem. Taking Design in the first year that it was offered on a large scale
    presented a lot of challenges, but even more opportunities.
    <br><br>
    We were randomly assigned groups and projects, and in the beginning (and for the next 7 months), it seemed like someone
    somewhere was out to get us. We were a group of complete strangers, and were given a project that no one understood. I
    vividly remember sitting in class with out faculty advisor, staring that the problem statement and trying to figure out
    what it was that they wanted from us.

    <p style="font-weight: bold">The Problem:</p>
    <p style="font-style: italic; padding: 30px">
      "We are building rectifying antennas and selective emmitters for energy harvesting of thermal radiation. Ideal thermal
      radiation is described by Plank's Law and is broadband. The purpose of this project is to design a mechanism for measuring
      thermal radiation and reporting power density across the band of frequencies expected to be present according to Plank's
      Law at varying distances from the source. Students choose the thermal source, the method for measuring or calculating power
      density, the appropriate sensor, and the platform for measuring at different distances. We are building a similar device
      to measure the output of or selective emmiter as well as the performance of the rectenna in response to the known performance
      of a real thermal source at 28.3THz/10.6Âµm."
