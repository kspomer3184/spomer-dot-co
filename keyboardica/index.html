  <h2>The keyboard whose fame far outweighs its abilities</h2>
  <p>
	Keyboardica is probably the least successful hackathon project that I've even been a part of. But somehow, it ended up being a great example about what hackathons are all about.
	<br><br>
	The pressure seemed pretty high upon returning to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for my 3rd time at HackRiddle. Just last year, my team and I gained a repuation as the
	toaster guys(read more about Toastifai <a href="../toastifai">here</a>). Everyone had really high hopes that we would make some awesome hardware hack again. The problem was
	that we had absolutely no ideas. We spent probably the first 3 or 4 hours "brainstorming". Since absolutly no worthwhile ideas were coming to us, we decided just to have fun
	with it this time.  We had a bunch of hardware and a toy keyboard, and if we could make a toaster smart, then why not a keyboard?
