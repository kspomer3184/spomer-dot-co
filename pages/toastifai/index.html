  <h2>The Toaster that took the World by Storm</h2>
  <p>Okay, maybe not the world, but it was still pretty cool. <br></p>
  <p style = "font-size:18px">
  Toastifai is an internet connected toaster powered by machine learning and
  computer vision. It was developed by my team (Frank Calas and Jessie Pullaro) and
  I at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University's hackathon, HackRiddle.
  <br><br>
  The inspiration for Toastifai came from a friend of ours complaining about his
  daily struggles with making toast. Whether it was burning the toast, or forgetting it in
  the toaster. We immediately started coming up with ways that we could use that idea at
  the hackathon the next day. Things like non-linear timing patterns and capacitors with
  toast dielectrics were eventually rejected. What did stick was the idea to use computer
  vision to monitor the bread's progress on its journey to become toast.
  <br><br>
  That same night I went out and bought 2 loaves of bread and the best toaster $8 can buy, and gathered together
  all of the random hardware that I thought might be helpful in making a 'smart' toaster. After
  arriving at the event the next morning, and learning about the sponsored prizes, we decided to
  change our approach. A machine learning company called Clarifai, which specializes in image based
  learning models was offering a prize for the best use of their services. So, with the encouragement of
  DSLR cameras and skate boards, we decided to not just make the perfect toaster, but to teach one how to
  perfect itself.
  <br><br>
  One of the most important questions that came up right away was "What is perfect toast?" To answer this, we made a bunch of toast,
  ranging from plain old bread, to nearly incinerated black rectangles. Jessie took off and asked as many of the organizers and other
  participants that he could what their preference was. The results were fairly well clustered around a single piece right in the middle.
  With this information, we were able to get to work. We each pretty quickly fell into separate roles. Jessie worked on getting the custom machine
  learning models built,
  Frank worked on getting openCV running to manipulate our images, and I started connecting the toaster to the internet.
  <br><br>
  If it weren't for all of the hardware issues that I ran into, connecting a toaster to the internet would have been nearly trivial.
  After a few hours of troubleshooting, I finally succeeded, using a relay module to disconnect power from the toaster
  (which conveniently causes it to pop the toast), which was controlled by a python script running on a raspberry pi. Using Twilio, I was
  able to send an alert via text message when the toast was done.

  At some point during the night, Max Farell, a friend of hours came through and helped us solve some issues with openCV, and decided to
  join the team. He took over the job of building a website so that we could qualify for another category prize.
  <br><br>
  After a few hours of rigging up a webcam to see into the toaster from above and implementing the computer vision and machine learning
  portions of the code, we were able to start training. We waited for 'perfect toast' and captured images with which we trained our Clarifai
  model. The model was now capable of deciding when the toast reached that ideal doneness, and sent the signal to turn off the toaster. We
  spent our remaining time tweaking the code and hardware to improve the results.
  <br><br>
  The demoing was a whirlwind of me giving my spiel over and over to participants and judges. I don't think we'll ever get "Toasters
  have an inherent problem" out of our heads. When it was all said and done, we didn't walk away with the prize we were going for, but instead
  came in 3rd place overall, and won Best Use of Amazon Web Services. The toaster seemed to follow us back to Poly, where the university wrote
  an <a href="#">article</a> on us, and we were featured on the local news (as well as somewhere in North Carolina I hear). Toastifai now lives in the
  Visualization & Technology Collaboration lab at Poly, with a mostly melted webcam from all of the times we ran it during demoing.

  For us, this project was more about a proof of concept than a real business idea. We hope to show what machine learning can do and how it can
  be applied in places you'd never think of. For now, at least, we hope to shoot higher than the small kitchen appliance field.
