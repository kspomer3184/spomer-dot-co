<h2>Organizing Florida Poly's Largest Hackathon</h2>
  <br><p style = "font-size:18px">
	My journey as a student hacker began with the very first PolyHacks, so when I was offered the opportunity to be a lead organizer for it's second year, 
	I was really excited. After a meeting in the summer of 2016, it was decided that 5 of my closest friends and I would work together to organize the event.
	I would be in charge of the sponsorship team. I would be responsible for acquiring the funding that we would need to make the event happen. 
	<br><br>
	We were a little slow to get off the ground with our planning. We quickly handled the very important details, such as locking in a date, and securing a 
	venue. The less obvious details took more time. Throughout the fall we worked on brand of the event, creating our mascot, Paul. We also determined some 
	details like the kinds of meals that we wanted to serve. The majority of our effort was focused on bureaucracy, figuring out how we were going to handle 
	passing funds into the school, as well as receiving funding from our SGA.

	In December, we began reaching out to potential sponsors. We sent out hundreds of emails to companies that we hoped would be interested in the event. We found
	several companies that were interested in the event, but not in financially sponsoring it. They offered us things like swag and API credits, that would allow
	us to improve the event for the attendees. When it was almost too late, we finally found a financial sponsor that would, in addition to student government funds,
	allow us to pay for all of the things we needed.
	<br><br>
	The month preceeding the event was a frenzy of ordering and organizing. When the event finally arrived, it hardly felt real. I spent the whole weekend running 
	around, answering questions, finding power strips, serving meals and announcing events. 24 hours, and more food than we could handle later, 34 teams had built 
	amazing projects to real world problems. It was a great time, and I think the only thing better than building something at a hackathon, is making it possible for others to do so.
